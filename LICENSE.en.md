## Definitions 

- **"Artificial Intelligence System" (AI System):** 
    Any machine learning or artificial intelligence technology that generates
    code or contributions with minimal direct human input. "Minimal direct
    human input" refers to limited human involvement primarily for supervision
    or final approval. Contributions incorporating existing licensed material
    must comply with the original license terms. For the purposes of this
    license, "minimal" is defined as less than 10% of the total development
    effort. AI-generated contributions must be accompanied by a detailed
    disclosure and verification process as outlined by the Licensor.

- **"Contribution":** 
    Any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions to
    existing work, submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Work, by an
    individual, legal entity, or AI System. This includes any material that
    is novel or that adds value to the Work. Contributions must be substantive
    and must not include trivial changes.

- **"Enterprise":**
    An organization with annual revenue exceeding $10 million USD in the
    previous fiscal year or more than 100 employees. Entities using complex
    structures to avoid this threshold, such as splitting into smaller
    entities, are included. The total revenue and employee count will be
    aggregated for related entities under common control.

- **"Security Fix":**
    Any modification addressing a security vulnerability, designated as a
    Security Fix by the submitter and accepted by the Licensor following the
    specified acceptance criteria and process outlined by the Licensor. The
    criteria include a detailed description of the vulnerability, the impact
    assessment, and testing evidence that confirms the fix.

- **"Verified Contribution":**
    A Contribution reviewed and confirmed by the contributor to behave as
    intended and comply with this License, particularly if generated by an AI
    System. This includes running tests and ensuring it does not violate any
    third-party rights. Verification must include comprehensive documentation
    of the testing process and results.

- **"Work":**
    The collective software, content, and documentation covered by this
    License, including all Contributions made by various contributors.

- **"Utilization":**
    The extent to which an Enterprise uses the Work, measured by factors such
    as the number of end-users, scale of deployment, or integration into
    products or services. Specific metrics will be provided by the Licensor
    as needed and must be reported accurately and periodically
    by the Enterprise.

- **"You" (or "Your"):**
    An individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by
    this License.

## License Grants

1. **Redistribution and Use:**
    You may reproduce, prepare derivative works, publicly display, distribute,
    and perform the Work and derivative works in source or object form.
    Attribution requirements must be met where applicable, following the
    guidelines provided by the Licensor. Attribution must include the original
    author(s), the name of the Work, and a link to the original repository.
    Distribution of derivative works in object form must be accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source code.

2. **Patent Grant:**
    Each Contributor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, use, offer
    to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work. Conflicts with
    other licenses or patents held by contributors must be resolved through
    the specified process by the Licensor, which includes mediation
    or arbitration.

3. **Contribution of Security Fixes:**
    If You make or become aware of a Security Fix, You must submit it to the
    Licensor following the specified process, which includes providing
    detailed documentation and code. The process must include a vulnerability
    report, steps to reproduce, and proof of the fix. AI-assisted submissions
    must be Verified Contributions.

4. **AI-Generated Contributions:**
    AI-generated Contributions must be disclosed and verified. You are
    responsible for their compliance and non-infringement of third-party
    rights. Verification must include documentation of the AI generation
    process and the steps taken to ensure compliance. Disputes over
    compliance and third-party rights infringement will be handled through a
    process specified by the Licensor, which includes independent review and
    arbitration. AI-generated contributions must be open-sourced
    under this License.

5. **Funding or Copyleft Option for Enterprises:**
    >If You are an Enterprise:

    1. You may contribute financially to the maintenance and development of
        the Work, with amounts specified by the Licensor. The specific
        contribution amounts and payment details will be outlined by the 
        Licensor, based on factors such as the Enterprise's size and level of utilization.

    2. If opting out of financial contribution, you must release the entire 
        application, if it includes the Work, under this License or a 
        compatible open-source license with copyleft provisions. You must 
        also provide all users access to the application's Corresponding 
        Source under this License. "Corresponding Source" includes all source 
        code necessary to build, maintain, and modify the application, 
        including build scripts and installation instructions.

6. **License Versioning and Upgrades:**
    You agree to be bound by the current SOSL version as specified by the 
    Licensor. You will be notified of new versions via the Licensorâ€™s 
    official communication channels, and the process for transitioning to 
    new versions will be detailed by the Licensor. Transition to new 
    versions must be completed within six months of notification.

## Responsible Disclosure of Vulnerabilities

7. **Vulnerability Disclosure:**
    > If You discover a Vulnerability in the Work:

    - Promptly notify the Licensor confidentially, following the process 
        defined by the Licensor. The typical notification timeframe is within 
        14 days of discovery. Notifications must include a detailed report of
        the vulnerability.

    - Provide a reasonable timeframe, typically 90 days, for the Licensor to
        address the Vulnerability before public disclosure. Extensions to
        this timeframe must be agreed upon in writing.

    - Refrain from exploiting the Vulnerability in ways that could harm the
        Licensor, users, or the public. 

## Conditions and Limitations

- **Source Code and Patch Files:**
    Source code must be provided in modifiable form. Distribution of the Work
    in modified form and patch files for build-time modifications is
    permitted. "Modifiable form" includes source code in a format that allows
    for editing and recompilation, such as plain text files or files that can
    be opened in standard development environments. It must also include any
    necessary documentation to understand and build the source code.
    Derivative works distributed in object form must include the
    Corresponding Source code.

- **Derived Works:**
    Modifications and derived works must be allowed under the same terms as
    the original Work. Acknowledgment of the original Work must be included
    in derived works, clearly indicating the source of the original Work,
    and must follow the attribution requirements specified by the Licensor.
    All derived works must be licensed under this License.

- **Trademark Use:**
    No permission is granted to use the Licensor's trade names, trademarks,
    service marks, or product names, except for describing the origin of the
    Work. Any other use requires explicit written permission from the
    Licensor. Descriptive use must be limited to factual statements about the
    origin and must not imply endorsement.

- **Dispute Resolution:**
    Disputes will be resolved under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
    owner of the original repository resides, and in accordance with the laws
    of that jurisdiction. An arbitration clause may be included to provide a
    faster resolution process, where arbitration will be conducted under the
    rules specified by the Licensor. Arbitration will take place in a neutral
    location agreed upon by both parties.

- **Termination:**
    The License will terminate automatically upon any breach by You. Derived
    works from compliant entities will not have their licenses terminated.
    The process for addressing and remedying breaches before termination will
    be specified by the Licensor, providing a reasonable period (typically
    30 days) to cure the breach. If the breach is not cured within this
    period, termination will proceed.

## Warranty Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

- **Warranty Disclaimer:**
    The Work is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or
    implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, 
    fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Licensor and 
    contributors make no guarantee of the Work's performance or suitability 
    for any specific use. This disclaimer applies to the fullest extent 
    permitted by applicable law.

- **Limitation of Liability:**
    In no event shall the Licensor or contributors be liable for any claim, 
    damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or 
    otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Work or the 
    use or other dealings in the Work. This includes, but is not limited to, 
    indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. 
    Statutory exceptions to this limitation may apply.

## Interpretation and Amendments

- **Interpretation:**
    Any ambiguities or unforeseen situations will be handled according to 
    the general intent of the License. Specific interpretations may be 
    issued by the Licensor, and these interpretations will be binding. In 
    cases of dispute, a neutral third-party mediator may be appointed to 
    resolve ambiguities.

- **Amendments:**
    Changes to the License will be handled according to the process 
    specified by the Licensor. Users will be notified of any amendments 
    via the Licensor's official communication channels and provided with 
    the rationale and implications. Users will have an opportunity to 
    provide feedback or objections within a specified period (typically 
    60 days). Significant amendments require a majority approval from 
    contributors.
